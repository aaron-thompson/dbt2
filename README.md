# DBT-2 Benchmark

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/nuodb/dbt2.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nuodb/dbt2)

## Introduction

This is a fork of the DBT-2 benchmark. The source here has been improved and cleaned
up so that it cleanly and reliably compiles. It also has support for NuoDB, which its
upstream partner does not have; the README for that file is located in this same
directory, so read that if you wish to benchmark NuoDB. Note, this is a work in progress
and we will be adding in more scripts supporting the testing of distributed database
technology.

If you plan on using this, you ought to at least read the requirements and install
sections of the NuoDB README as it details some requirements not detailed clearly in
the original README, now named README-INTRO.
