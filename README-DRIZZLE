This release of dbt2 was proofed again the 2010.11.04 build.

To build and run with Drizzle, run the following steps:

1. Build the tools

	 % rm -f CMakeCache.txt
	 % cmake CMakeLists.txt -DDBMS="drizzle" && make && make install

2. Set the DBT2DATADIR environment variable to the path of the datadir.

	 % export DBT2DATADIR=/tmp/dbt2

3. Generate the data, specifying the number of warehouses with the -w
   option and the location of where to store the generated data.

	% mkdir /tmp/data
	% dbt2-datagen -w 10 -d /tmp/data --drizzle

4. Create the database.

	% mkdir -p /tmp/dbt2
	% dbt2-drizzle-admin -w /usr -s start \
	  -p "--no-defaults --datadir /tmp/dbt2"

5. Load the data into the database (assumes you have a version of
   drizzled already running) specifying the path of the generated data and
   the path to the drizzle client

	% dbt2-drizzle-load-db --path /tmp/data --drizzle_path /usr/bin/drizzle

6. Run the test and generate test results

	% dbt2-run-workload -a drizzle -i /usr -c 10 -d 300 -w 10 -o /tmp/results \
	  -D dbt2 -p "--no-defaults --datadir /tmp/dbt2"

Output should look similar to:

25.86 new-order transactions per minute (NOTPM)
1.9 minute duration
0 total unknown errors
2 rollback transactions
3 second(s) ramping up

NOTE: Make sure that number of warehouses (option -w) is less than or equal
(not greater) to the number of warehouses that were created when you generated
your data

Results and log files can be found in /tmp/results

Some of the useful log files:

  /tmp/results/client/${HOST}.1/error.log - client errors
  /tmp/results/driver/${HOST}.1/error.log - driver errors
  /tmp/results/mix.log - info about performed transactions
  /tmp/results/report.txt - results of the test
